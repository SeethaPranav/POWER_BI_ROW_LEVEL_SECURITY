# POWER_BI_ROW_LEVEL_SECURITY
Implementing row-level security in Power BI using a sales performance dataset and user access control.

This repository demonstrates the implementation of row-level security (RLS) in Power BI using a sample sales performance dataset. RLS ensures that users can only view the data relevant to their roles, enhancing data security and compliance.

# Overview

- Dataset: The project utilizes a sales performance dataset that includes information such as date, product, category, region, country, city, sales amount, profit, quantity sold, and customer feedback.
  
- User Access Control: A User Access table is created to define which users can access specific regions, facilitating dynamic data visibility based on user roles.
  
- Implementation Steps: The README provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up the dataset, create a User Access table, define roles, and test the RLS functionality.
  
This project is useful for anyone looking to understand and implement data security measures in Power BI, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.
